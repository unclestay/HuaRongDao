There are 8 numbers from 1 to 8. Put them in a square of 3×3, and there is a blank. 
The blank can exchange with the numbers. It can be seen like the blank is moving.
3 4 1 
5 6  
8 2 7
 
If it becomes orderly from 1 to 8 like below, the game successes. 
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 
 
1.We need a data structure to describe the process.
2.There is an initial state, we should know if the game can success or not, and how to move.
 
 
The blank has four choices: up, down, right or left. And we give it a order: up→right→down→left.
The blank go to a new state, and if it will go to the same road that we have gone before, we return from the original road.
